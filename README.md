## Information

*This part is for coders who are new to Machine Learning*

These questions should be answered at first, "What is Machine Learning?, What should I study to learn Machine Learning?, What is the relationship between Machine Learning and Finance? "

First of all, Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. ML is a method paradigm that makes inferences from existing data using mathematical and statistical methods and makes predictions about what is not known with these inferences.

Secondly, Our favorite programming language is *Python* nowadays for #MachineLearning.[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/), [Scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) are Python Libraries which are used in Machine Learning.

## Algorithms of ML

These are some Machine Learning algorithms and models

### Supervised Learning : All data is labeled and the algorithms learn to predict the output from the input data.
- Regression
 - Linear Regression 
 - Ordinary Least Squares
 - Logistic Regression
 - Stepwise Regression
 - Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines 
  - Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing 
- Classification
  - k-nearest neighbor
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Decision Trees 
   - ID3 algorithm
   - C4.5 algorithm
- Ensemble Learning
 - Boosting
 - Bagging
 - Random Forest
 - AdaBoost

### Unsupervised Learning : All data is unlabeled and the algorithms learn to inherent structure from the input data.
- Clustering
  - Hierchical clustering
  - k-means
  - Fuzzy clustering
  - Mixture models
- Neural Networks
 - Self-organizing map
 - Adaptive resonance theory
 
### Semi-Supervised Learning : Some data is labeled but most of it is unlabeled and a mixture of supervised and unsupervised techniques can be used.

### Reinforcement Learning : Learning what to do in an environment and how to map situations to actions to maximize a reward signal
- Q Learning
- SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) algorithm
- Temporal difference learning
- Genetic algorithm
- Deep Q-Network(DQN)
